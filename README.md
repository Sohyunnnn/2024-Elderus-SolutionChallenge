## ✨Introduction
*How lonely and hopeless is the moment of lonely death when an elderly person living alone, disconnected from everyone, cannot ask for help and is left alone?*


**Elderus** is an abnormal behavior detection service that solves the problem of lonely death caused by social isolation of the elderly living alone. Currently, the rate of aging and the rate of elderly living alone are increasing worldwide, and as a result, lonely death caused by isolation and health problems of the elderly living alone has become an important social problem. Therefore, we will help the elderly living alone to immediately detect and receive appropriate treatment when they are in an emergency.

Elderus, a service we produced, installs a home camera to detect abnormal behavior, such as falls, to prevent the elderly living alone from dying alone. And when abnormal behavior is detected, it immediately sends a notification to the set guardian so that the guardian can quickly report it to the emergency room. This process prevents elderly people living alone in emergency situations from dying alone due to lack of treatment. In addition, it was considered that guardians can become persons of various relationships, such as family, friends, neighbors, and welfare workers. And it provides the elderly and their guardians with data from hospitals near the elderly's residence through Google Maps. This feature allows them to check information on the nearest hospital that can solve emergency situations.

**All of these features minimize late discovery from isolation and support healthy living of the elderly living alone to solve the biggest problems of the elderly living alone.**


The **living-alone elderly** is no longer alone. **we** overcome physical distancing through technology and come together. ✨
